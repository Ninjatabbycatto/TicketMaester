# TicketMaester

This web App is a **Client-side Ticketing Application for Dashlabs**.  
Since the teams used Plane.so for managing, which looks a lot like a kanban for tracking tasks, we opted to create a separate one as a mediator between clients and the Client Success team.

## This is TicketMaester.

This was made using **Laravel Framework**, and used **Filament add-ons** due to its simplicity and quick setup! Thanks to its ease of use, most of the site was developed in less than **3 days**, and after that, some minor tweaks for bugs.
